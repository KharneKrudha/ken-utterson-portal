Horror Dingbats Eerie Edition 2.0 - ©1998 Letters From The Claw

NOTE: this font replaces the old Horror Dingbats...you may toss HorrorDings 1.0 without regrets.

Eight terrifying images to dress up that resume', plus **17** new ones to make a full 26, all caps.  Two images were brazenly swiped from another of The Claw's horror fonts (Bloodsuckers) because they were JUST TOO COOL!  But you get 15 freshly-bleeding brand-new gory pix, so even if you previously had Horror Dingbats AND Bloodsuckers, you're still getting a bunch of cool new stuff here.  

This font is freeware.  Distribute indiscriminately.  Some of these images might be © Somebody Else, so I'd watch my back if you get commercial aspirations, this-font-wise.
